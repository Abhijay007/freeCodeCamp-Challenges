              C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Simple</strong>: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.</li>
              <li><strong>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent</strong>: A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.</li>
              <li><strong>Mid-level language</strong>: It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)</li>
              <li><strong>Rich library support</strong>: Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.</li>
              <li><strong>Speed of execution</strong>: C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.</li>
              <li><strong>Pointer and direct Memory-Access</strong>: C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).</li>
              <li><strong>Object-Oriented</strong>: One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.</li>
              <li><strong>Compiled Language</strong>: C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.</li>

          <header>Declaring variables</header>
          <article>
            <p>A typical variable declaration is of the form:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
            <code>// Declaring a single variable

              // Declaring multiple variables:
              type variable1_name, variable2_name, variable3_name;</code>
            <p>
              A variable name can consist of alphabets (both upper and lower case), numbers and the underscore ‘_’ character. However, the name must not start with a number.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
          <header>Data types</header>
          <article>
            <p>All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data-type with which it is declared. Every data type requires a different amount of memory.</p>
      
            <p>Data types in C++ is mainly divided into three types: </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Primitive Data Types</strong>: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char , float, bool etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are:&nbsp;<ul>
                  <li>Integer</li>
                  <li>Character</li>
                  <li>Boolean</li>
                  <li>Floating Point</li>
                  <li>Double Floating Point</li>
                  <li>Valueless or Void</li>
                  <li>Wide Character</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/derived-data-types-in-c/"><strong>Derived Data Types:</strong></a> The data-types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:&nbsp;<ul>
                  <li>Function</li>
                  <li>Array</li>
                  <li>Pointer</li>
                  <li>Reference</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-defined-derived-data-types-in-c/"><strong>Abstract or User-Defined Data Types</strong></a>: These data types are defined by user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:&nbsp;<ul>
                  <li>Class</li>
                  <li>Structure</li>
                  <li>Union</li>

          <header>if...else statement</header>
          <article>
            There come situations in real life when we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions, we decide what should we do next. Similar situations arise in programming also where we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions we will execute the next block of code. For example, in C if x occurs then execute y else execute z. There can also be multiple conditions like in C if x occurs then execute p, else if condition y occurs execute q, else execute r. This condition of C else-if is one of the many ways of importing multiple conditions.
      
            <p>
              if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is executed otherwise not. </p>
      
            <code>if(condition)
              {
              // Statements to execute if
              // condition is true
              }</code>
            Here, the condition after evaluation will be either true or false. C if statement accepts boolean values – if the value is true then it will execute the block of statements below it otherwise not. If we do not provide the curly braces ‘{‘ and ‘}’ after if(condition) then by default if statement will consider the first immediately below statement to be inside its block.
      
            <code>if(condition)
              statement1;
              statement2;
      
              // Here if the condition is true, if block
              // will consider only statement1 to be inside
              // its block.
            </code>
            In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
            evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
            them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
            to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
      
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
              statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
              statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
              statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
            It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
            because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
            the code. For example, do not use the following code:
            <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
            assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
            additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
      
            <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
          <header>while statement</header>
          <article>
            A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
            evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
      
            <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
            statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
            statement following the loop.
      
            <p>
              The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
              the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
              tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
              control is passed to the statement following while.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
              those statements.
            </p>
      
            Example:
      
            <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
      
            <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
            <p>
              With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
              Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
            </p>
      
            <ul>
              <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
              <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
              <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
              true, so the loop terminates.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
          <header>Function declarations</header>
          <article>
            A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
            statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
      
            <ul>
              <li>The name of the function.</li>
              <li>
                A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                separated by commas.
              </li>
              <li>
                The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                brackets, { }.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
            </p>
      
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p>
              The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
              consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
              function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
              specifies the value returned by the function.
            </p>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <p>
              Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
              value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
              the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
              the calling function.
